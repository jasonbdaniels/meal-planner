title: Sheet Pan Steak Fajitas
ingredients:
  - 1 1-pound skirt steak, cut into thin slices across the grain
  - 1 orange bell pepper, sliced thin
  - 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced thin
  - 1 red onion, sliced thin
  - 2 tablespoons Fajita Seasoning Mix
  - 1 tablespoon canola oil
  - 1/4 cup water
  - 8-10 corn tortillas
  - chopped cilantro
instructions:
  - Place the steak, peppers and onion in a large zip top bag. In a small bowl, whisk together the fajita seasoning, oil and water. Pour the mixture into the bag and press out the air. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight.
  - Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  - Using tongs, remove the meat and vegetables from the bag. Arrange in a single layer (the best you can) on a baking sheet and discard the marinade. Roast the fajita mixture in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the meat is cooked.
  - Serve with tortillas topped with chopped cilantro, sour cream and jalape√±os, if desired.
